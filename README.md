AngularJS Workshop
==================

In this workshop we will try to create an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) application that utilizes most aspects of the framework.
This workshop creates everything from scratch, step by step, so the participants can understand and follow how to build an AngularJS application.
It does not include building a production ready application (concatination, minification, less -> css) since it adds complexity.
